## Steps to run notebooks

It is assumed that `cuda` and `cudnn` are installed. All the experiments were performed on Google Colab which have all the dependencies prinstalled. The data should be placed in directory called `data` for running the notebooks.

The code experiments were run in the order of numeric prefixes in their filenames. These notebooks were used to generate intemediate models, some of which were used in the final ensemble.

The final submission can be generated by running `ensembling_submissions.ipynb` which creates `final_submission.csv` by ensembling submission files located in `intel_submissions/` directory. 

`lowest_confidence.csv` contains list of images which were mislabeled or confusing and were filtered at later steps.
